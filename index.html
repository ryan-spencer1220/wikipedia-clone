                            <p class = "card-text">Cardiff City beat Leeds United 2 to 1 in their third-round 2001 to 02 FA Cup football match at Ninian Park (pictured) in Cardiff on 6 January 2002. Premier League Leeds United were favourites as Cardiff City were tenth in the Second Division, two tiers below. As a Premier League team, Leeds entered the FA Cup in this round, while Cardiff had had to win two earlier matches. The gate was more than 22,000, a record at Ninian Park that season. Andy D'Urso was the referee. Leeds scored in the 12th minute via a goal from Mark Viduka. Cardiff equalised soon after with Graham Kavanagh scoring from a free-kick. Shortly before half-time, Leeds midfielder Alan Smith was sent off after clashing with Cardiff's Andy Legg, so Leeds had to play defensively in the second half. With three minutes remaining, Scott Young volleyed in the winning goal. Cardiff fans invaded the pitch and clashes between the two sets of supporters led to police intervention. Cardiff were eventually fined Â£20,000 for the pitch invasion.</p>
